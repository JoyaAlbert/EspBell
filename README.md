# EspBell Project

A complete IoT communication system based on MQTT that includes a desktop application, an ESP32 broker, and testing tools. To control a house doorbell connected to an ESP32.

## Project Components

### ðŸ“± APP
Electron desktop application for controlling and monitoring IoT devices. Features a modern interface with light/dark theme support and advanced MQTT connection management.

[View APP documentation](APP/README.md)

### ðŸ”Œ ESPbroker
MQTT broker implementation on ESP32, enabling efficient and secure IoT device communication.

Key features:
- Integrated MQTT broker on ESP32
- Customizable WiFi configuration
- Efficient connection management
- Low power consumption

[View ESPbroker documentation](ESPbroker/README.md)

### ðŸ§ª Tester
Testing tools for the MQTT system, including a web interface for connection testing and a WebSocket proxy.
